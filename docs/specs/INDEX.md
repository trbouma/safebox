# Specs Index

Safebox is a sovereign wallet-and-records platform built on Nostr, Cashu, and related open protocols. It is designed to let users hold funds and sensitive records under their own cryptographic control while still supporting practical, user-friendly workflows such as Lightning-address payments, NFC card interactions, and secure record sharing.

The core problem Safebox is addressing is the gap between convenience and sovereignty: most mainstream systems are easy to use but depend on centralized custodians and weak user control, while many self-sovereign tools are hard to operate at scale. Safebox uses a hybrid approach to reduce this tradeoff by combining familiar interfaces with end-user key ownership and application-layer payload security.
