# Community Governance Template Pack

## Overview
This pack defines reusable governance templates communities can adopt when deploying Safebox-based payment and record infrastructure.

## Scope
- Governance charter templates
- Role and responsibility templates
- Policy templates for trust, records, and payment operations
- Change and dispute handling templates

## Template Set
- Community Charter Template
- Trust Anchor Admission/Removal Template
- Record Stewardship Policy Template
- Incident and Disclosure Policy Template
- Dispute Resolution Workflow Template
- Community Acceptance Criteria Template

## Usage Guidance
- Start with minimum governance profile and expand as requirements mature.
- Align templates with local legal and cultural governance norms.
- Version-control governance decisions and change history.

## Adoption Model
- Pilot with limited scope community cohort.
- Collect feedback and update policy variants.
- Promote to production governance baseline after acceptance review.

## Security Considerations
- Governance policies must not bypass technical security controls.
- Access/control role definitions should align with least-privilege principles.
