# Operator Compliance Playbook

## Overview
This playbook provides practical controls for Safebox operators to meet legal, fiduciary, and governance obligations while preserving user privacy and key sovereignty principles.

## Scope
- Financial/payment operations
- Record/privacy stewardship
- Incident/legal response
- Auditability and governance reporting

## Control Areas
- Governance: define accountable operator roles and escalation authority.
- Policy: publish acceptable use, privacy, and lawful-process policies.
- Evidence: maintain tamper-evident logs and operational change history.
- Segregation: separate operational duties for admin, security, and release actions.

## Regulatory Readiness
- Map deployment to local financial/privacy regimes.
- Document retention/deletion obligations and legal-hold process.
- Maintain documented incident and authority response workflows.

## User and Counterparty Protection
- Clear disclosures on custody boundaries and user key responsibility.
- Transparent handling of outages, rollbacks, and transaction advisories.
- Prompt communication of incidents affecting data or funds.

## Audit and Assurance
- Periodic internal control review.
- External assessment where required by jurisdiction or partner policy.
- Corrective-action tracking for identified control gaps.

## Security Considerations
- Compliance tooling must not weaken cryptographic controls.
- Minimize sensitive data exposure in compliance reporting.
