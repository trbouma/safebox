# Convention on the Authentication of Private Records  
*(Private Apostille Convention)*

---

## PREAMBLE

The Contracting Parties to the present Convention,

Recognizing the growing importance of private records in cross-border civil, commercial, educational, financial, and digital interactions;

Observing that existing international authentication frameworks are primarily designed for public documents and do not adequately address the authentication of private records in a globally networked and digitally mediated environment;

Desiring to simplify, standardize, and harmonize the authentication of private records used across borders, without determining their legal effect;

Affirming that authentication concerns the **origin, integrity, and authorship** of a record and does not imply validation of its content, legality, or enforceability;

Have agreed as follows:

The Certificate of Authentication of Origin shall certify only:

a. the identity of the Issuer of the private record;  
b. the capacity in which the Issuer acted;  
c. the integrity of the private record at the time of authentication;

1. The Certificate shall conform to a standardized model annexed to this Convention.
2. The Certificate may be issued:
   - in physical form;
   - in electronic form;
   - as a cryptographically verifiable record.
3. Certificates issued electronically shall be capable of independent verification without requiring direct contact with the issuing authority.

## Article 7 – Registers and Verification

1. Each Competent Authentication Authority shall maintain a register of Certificates issued.
2. Registers may be implemented through:
   - centralized databases;
   - distributed registries;
   - cryptographic or ledger-based verification mechanisms.
